Build a blog on every public web space! No server side application needs, just a public address. Take it and brings home Wordpress!

How to begin
----

To start blogging is pretty simple:
  1. Clone this repo in a comfortable location of your disk
  2. Only for the first time type ```npm install``` to prepare the environment
  3. Every time you wantto add a new post type ```./bin/blog --post new``` in a terminal from the main folder of this repo
  4. Follow the procedure
  5. Put all the folders to a public webspace (i.e. Dropbox or Free webhosting account)
  6. Now you are a blogger!

The application need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to run the helper script. 
Install it on your machine, you'll thank me for all the rest of your life!
